# PETSTORE-API-POSTMAN-TESTING
The project goal was to test three endpoints in the Store section of the https://petstore.swagger.io/#/ API. The endpoints that were analyzed were:

POST /store/order
GET /store/order/{orderId}
DELETE /store/order/{orderId}
To ensure comprehensive testing, a table template was created to describe each endpoint. This helped to keep track of the inputs, outputs, and any relevant parameters associated with each request.

In addition, 5 positive and 5 negative test cases were written for each endpoint. This helped to ensure that the API was working correctly and that it could handle different scenarios and inputs appropriately.

To manage the testing process, requests were structured and saved in Postman. Sample requests were saved in an xls file, and screenshots of requests and project structure in Postman were taken.

Finally, a task was created in Jira to describe the testing process. The task included all relevant information, including the table template for describing the endpoints, the positive and negative test cases, the Postman requests, and the screenshots. This helped to ensure that the testing process was documented and that all relevant information was available for future reference.
